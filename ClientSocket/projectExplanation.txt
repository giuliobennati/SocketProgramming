Create a console application that will be used by 2 devices
The scope of this console app is to exchange message between these 2 devices using network(so using socket)

So each of the devices have to listen for incoming message and also has send message.

NOTES:
->Socket are bi-direzional, that mean that you can write/read using the same socket.
->before sending the message, we need to convert it into a byte array
->thanks to the ‘receive‘ method we are going to get a byte array as answer by the server.


COSE DA FARE DOMANI:
stampa un menu con i seguenti campi:
a)esegui una connessione
b)manda un messaggio (inserisci una stringa)
c)elimina la connessione
